/**
 * This class represents a Board and all its components needed to play
 * the 3 stones game. A Board is composed of a gameBoard, a two dimensional array
 * of 11 by 11. The board is made to be 11 by 11 to not run into an 
 * IndexOutOfBounds exception. Each slot in the array is represented by a number
 * that will dictate the state each slot is in. 0 represents a slot where either
 * the server or the client can make a move in. 1 represents a slot where the client
 * has already made a move in. 2 represents a slot where the server has made a 
 * move in. 9 represents a space where making a move in is impossible. The board
 * class also keeps track of the player score, the server score and the last slot
 * where a move was made in.
